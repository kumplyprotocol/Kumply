# KUMPLY 🛡️

**The First Institutional-Grade Compliance Identity Layer for the AVALANCHE® Public Blockchain**

KUMPLY provides non-custodial, on-chain identity verification (KYC/KYB/KYA) for the AVALANCHE® network. By bridging real-world regulatory compliance with DeFi anonymity, we empower institutions, exchanges, and autonomous AI agents to operate seamlessly across the C-Chain and custom AVALANCHE® L1s without compromising user privacy.

*Built for the AVALANCHE® LatAm Hackathon (2026).*

## 🌐 Live Contracts (Fuji Testnet)

All our smart contracts are deployed and verified on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet.

- **AttestationStore**: [`0x9Bbb0797EA92277c268fe7E45BdB16b70E787d76`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x9Bbb0797EA92277c268fe7E45BdB16b70E787d76)
- **ComplianceGate**: [`0x3Bf8F8ea2573Eb3f386aDF72D191869c4827062B`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x3Bf8F8ea2573Eb3f386aDF72D191869c4827062B)

## ⚡ The Problem

As DeFi scales and institutions enter the Avalanche ecosystem, a massive friction point exists: **Compliance**. 
DApps must enforce KYC/AML laws, but forcing users to verify their identity on every single DApp destroys UX and creates dangerous data honeypots. Furthermore, the rise of Autonomous AI Agents trading on-chain brings a new question: *Who is legally responsible for this agent's actions?*

## 💡 The Solution

KUMPLY is a "Verify Once, Use Everywhere" protocol.
1. Users/Businesses/Agents complete identity verification via our licensed partner (Sumsub).
2. We issue a 100% privacy-preserving **on-chain attestation credential** to their wallet.
3. Avalanche Smart Contracts can check a user's compliance Tier (`1-5`) natively via our `AttestationStore` or `ComplianceGate` without touching personal data.

### Verification Tiers
- **Tier 1 (Basic)**: Email & Phone Verification
- **Tier 2 (Standard)**: Government ID + Liveness Check (KYC)
- **Tier 3 (Enhanced)**: Proof of Address + Source of Funds
- **Tier 4 (Business)**: Corporate Verification (KYB) + UBO Disclosure
- **Tier 5 (Agentic)**: AI Agent Verification (KYA) - Linking autonomous software to verified owners.

## 🏗️ Architecture

KUMPLY is built entirely around the Avalanche technical stack (May 2026 standards):

- **Encrypted ERC (eERC)**: Identity attestations remain private and encrypted. Only authorized compliance protocols can read the underlying data.
- **Avalanche L1 Interoperability**: Through Interchain Messaging (ICM), a credential minted on the C-Chain can be queried seamlessly from any customized Avalanche L1 (formerly Subnets), enabling cross-chain compliance out-of-the-box.
- **Software-Only Protocol**: We never store user documents. Data is processed securely by Sumsub, while Kumply exclusively handles the cryptographic on-chain proofs.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.28, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Vanilla CSS (custom design system)
- **Web3 Interaction**: Wagmi v3, Viem v2, MetaMask / Core Wallet
- **SDK**: `@kumply/sdk` (TypeScript package for DApps)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- pnpm >= 10.0.0

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KumplyProtocol/kumply.git
   cd kumply
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Setup environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your specific keys (WalletConnect ID, Sumsub credentials if running locally)
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   *The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`*

## 🔐 For Developers: Using the Kumply SDK

Integrating KUMPLY into your DApp is incredibly simple:

```typescript
import { KumplyClient } from '@kumply/sdk';

const client = new KumplyClient({ network: 'fuji' });

// Check if a user has passed KYC Tier 2
const result = await client.verify('0xUserAddress');

if (result.verified && result.tier >= 2) {
    // Allow deposit
} else {
    // Block action
}
```

Or enforce it directly in your Solidity Contracts:

```solidity
import {ComplianceGate} from "./ComplianceGate.sol";

contract MyDeFiVault is ComplianceGate {
    constructor(address _attestationStore) ComplianceGate(_attestationStore, 2) {}

    function deposit() external {
        _requireVerified(msg.sender); // Automatically reverts if not Tier 2+
        // ... execute deposit
    }
}
```

## 📜 Compliance & Brand Alignment

KUMPLY rigorously adheres to the May 2026 Ava Labs Trademark Usage Policy and AVALANCHE® ecosystem guidelines:

- ✅ Uses **AVALANCHE®** and **AVAX®** as adjectives (never as nouns or verbs)
- ✅ Uses the official **"AVALANCHE® L1"** nomenclature (not "Subnets")
- ✅ Implements **eERC** (Encrypted ERC) for privacy-preserving credentials
- ✅ Categorizes autonomous actors as **"AI Agents"** with KYA verification
- ✅ Follows **responsible disclosure** practices for security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Operates as **Software-Only** infrastructure — non-custodial, no financial intermediation
- ✅ Published under **MIT License** for open-source transparency
