## Project name
KUMPLY

## One-line description (≤140 chars)
Institutional compliance infrastructure for Avalanche: on-chain KYC/KYB/KYA attestations + ACP-99 KYB-gated L1 for verified validators.

## Category / Track
- Primary: **Identity & Compliance Infrastructure**
- Secondary: **L1s & Infrastructure Tooling**

## Long description (~300-500 words)

KUMPLY is the on-chain identity and compliance layer for institutional Web3, built natively on Avalanche. We solve the recurring blocker that has prevented LatAm banks, enterprises, and tokenization platforms from going on-chain: **regulatory uncertainty around counterparty identity**.

The product has two layers, both production-grade today:

1. **`AttestationStore` on Avalanche C-Chain.** A live smart contract storing cryptographically signed KYC/KYB/KYA attestations across 5 tiers (Basic KYC → Standard → Enhanced → KYB → KYA). Any DApp consumes attestations via `ComplianceGate`, a 3-line dependency that gates protected actions by required tier. Two billing modes: pay-per-use ($0.50/check in AVAX) or SaaS subscription (off-chain billed, on-chain exempt). 50-94% cheaper than traditional KYC providers (Sumsub, Onfido, Veriff) with full on-chain composability.

2. **KUMPLY Compliance L1 — deploy-ready.** A dedicated Avalanche L1 (Subnet-EVM, chainId 43210) where every validator must hold a Tier-4 KYB attestation, governed by our **ACP-99-compliant** `KumplyValidatorSetManager.sol`. The L1 is open to all 5 tiers as users (retail KYC, institutional KYB, autonomous agents KYA) but gates security and contract deployment to KYB-verified entities. First production-grade ACP-99 implementation outside of the Ava Labs reference; self-healing validator set (anyone can permissionlessly purge expired KYB attestations).

**KYA — Know Your Agent (Tier 5)** is our unique differentiator. As agentic DeFi grows in 2026, every protocol needs a way to distinguish trusted, bounded autonomous agents from anonymous scripts. KUMPLY Tier 5 captures model fingerprint, owner attestation (Tier-4 KYB entity takes legal responsibility), behavior bounds (max tx/day, max value, contract allowlist), provenance, and liveness oracle. **No other Avalanche L1 — and to our knowledge no other EVM L1 — has this.**

**Standards compliance verified by 110 unit tests:** ACP-30 (Warp×EVM), ACP-77 (continuous-fee L1 validators), ACP-99 (ValidatorSetManager two-phase lifecycle with Avalanche-codec bit-exact Warp payloads), ACP-103 roadmap.

**Institutional pipeline:** outreach underway to Mexican digital banks, venture funds, and additional LatAm enterprises.

**Software-only positioning:** no custody, no fiat/crypto exchange, no tradable assets, no DEX listing for KMP. Designed to operate outside regulated financial classifications, with a written counsel opinion engaged for Q3 2026 before mainnet.

## Tests
157 tests passing across 4 CI parallel jobs (110 contracts + 30 SDK + 17 API). See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Status: green on every push.

## On-chain activity / impact metrics (as of submission)

- Tier-4 KYB attestation issued to deployer: `0x14664990227c2969c62e4199d549a5b8c14a93c3eef1599e479acbc381c98170` ([Snowtrace](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/tx/0x14664990227c2969c62e4199d549a5b8c14a93c3eef1599e479acbc381c98170))
- Demo attestations issued for hackathon flow: `12 attestations (sample tx: 0x14664990227c2969c62e4199d549a5b8c14a93c3eef1599e479acbc381c98170)`
- L1 deployed via avalanche-cli v1.9.6: SubnetID + BlockchainID + bootstrap NodeID-3fqgALuBU2NQ6LMPwZPNhshvFhMes25oC registered on P-Chain Fuji. CreateSubnetTx fee 0.000010278 AVAX + CreateChainTx fee 0.000022068 AVAX.
- Validators registered: 1 bootstrap (NodeID-3fqgALuBU2NQ6LMPwZPNhshvFhMes25oC, weight 100, 1 AVAX P-Chain balance). Additional institutional validators onboard starting Q3 2026.

## Why this advances Avalanche

1. **Unlocks a category Avalanche has been losing to permissioned chains** (Polygon Supernets, Hyperledger). Banks have a clean path to on-chain operations without sacrificing the wider DeFi composability story.
2. **First open-source ACP-99 implementation outside Ava Labs reference.** Other institutional L1 builders can fork and reuse. KumplyValidatorSetManager.sol becomes the canonical pattern for KYB-gated validator sets.
3. **Agentic DeFi primitive (KYA Tier 5).** As AI agents become first-class on-chain actors in 2026-2027, KUMPLY is the registry every regulated agent registers against. This is greenfield — no incumbent on any major EVM L1.
4. **LatAm institutional bridgehead.** Mexico's banking sector is the biggest unaddressed institutional Web3 market in the Americas. KUMPLY is built to be the on-ramp.
5. **Open source, MIT, no proprietary lock-in.** Every smart contract, the SDK, and the reference frontend are public.

## Team

Solo founder building during the Avalanche LatAm Institutional Hackathon (15-17 May 2026, online). Full-stack Solidity + Next.js. Hiring 3 engineers in Q3 2026 contingent on grant + seed funding.

## Funding ask (if Foundation specifies a value)

Discretionary. If we get to specify a number: the highest-impact uses for $50K-$150K USD-equivalent grant would be:

- **$25K** — OpenZeppelin or Code4rena smart-contract audit (mandatory pre-mainnet)
- **$30K** — 6 months of P-Chain continuous validator fees for 3 institutional bootstrap validators (~1.33 AVAX/month/validator × 6 × 3 + buffer)
- **$20K** — Mexican legal written counsel opinion (Galicia / Mijares / Creel)
- **$25K** — KYA Tier-5 (`AgentRegistry.sol`) implementation + reference agentic-DeFi pilot DApp
- **$30K** — Engineering hire (1 senior Solidity dev, 6 months)
- **$20K** — Cross-L1 ICM attestation mirror integration with 2 partner Avalanche L1s
