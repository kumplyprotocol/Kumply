- **Demo video:** `[FILL: 30-90s walkthrough URL]` (to record post-deploy)

## 6. Market analysis (Team1 explicit requirement)

**Problem we solve.** LatAm financial institutions face a structural blocker to Web3 adoption: no compliant counterparty-resolution layer. Banco Bankaool, Arkangeles, and dozens of LatAm fintechs have publicly stated they want to deploy on-chain products but cite "no on-chain KYC primitive trusted by regulators" as the gating concern. Current workarounds (off-chain whitelists, per-DApp KYC, permissioned forks) all fragment liquidity and break composability.

**Market size.**
- LatAm Web3 adoption: Mexico alone has ~12M crypto users (Chainalysis 2025), with traditional banking penetration at 56% — a massive opportunity for bank-grade on-chain rails.
- Global on-chain identity market: projected $1.8B by 2027 (Spherical Insights), with institutional segment growing fastest.
- Agentic DeFi (KYA target market): emerging 2026-2027, projected to drive 15-30% of DeFi volume by EOY 2027 (Messari forecast).

**Pricing benchmark.** Traditional KYC providers (Sumsub, Onfido, Veriff) charge $1-$8 per verification with no on-chain composability and no programmatic API for smart contracts. KUMPLY's $0.50 per-check is a 50-94% cost reduction, plus the compliance data is reusable across every Avalanche DApp the user touches — per-user lifetime cost trends toward zero as the network effect compounds.

**Initial customer pipeline (under NDA):**
- 2 LatAm banks (Bankaool, Arkangeles — Mexico)
- 3 LatAm fintechs (names redacted, pre-LOI conversations)
- 1 LatAm tokenization platform (real-world assets, pre-pilot)

## 7. Revenue model — how it might work (Team1 explicit ask)

Software-only B2B, four streams:

| Stream | Customer | Pricing | Year-1 conservative target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SaaS subscription** | Regulated institutions (banks, ITFs) | MXN/USD monthly fixed (CFDI invoice) | 3 customers × $3K MRR = $108K ARR |
| **Pay-per-use API** | DApps, autonomous agents, small teams | $0.50/call in AVAX | $200K ARR (~33K monthly checks) |
| **L1 gas (KMP)** | Validators + DApps on KUMPLY L1 | Native L1 fees | rounds to zero year 1 |
| **Verifier-as-a-Service** | KYC providers wanting on-chain distribution | License + rev share | 1 partner × $50K license |

Year-1 conservative ARR target: **~$350K** with 3 paying institutions + DApp self-serve traffic.

Breakeven on operating costs (lean: 3 engineers + audit amortized + infra) at ~50K monthly verifications — a single mid-size LatAm fintech customer.

## 8. Risk-taking / iteration speed (Team1 explicit ask)

Solo founder built the entire stack — Solidity, TypeScript SDK, Express API, Next.js 16 frontend, ACP-99 validator manager, CI pipeline, Sumsub integration, public frontend — during the Avalanche LatAm Institutional Hackathon (May 15-17, 2026). Rate of shipping: ~2-3 substantive features per day, 157 tests passing, multiple regulatory pivots already absorbed (added software-only positioning mid-stream after legal scoping).

Recent iteration evidence:
- Detected and fixed non-ACP-99-conformant initial implementation mid-hackathon (rewrote 400+ lines of Solidity to ship a verified Avalanche-codec round-trip in the test harness).
- Pivoted KMP tokenomics from speculative 4-bucket split to defensible 100% testnet-deployer alloc with legal disclaimers embedded in `genesis.json` itself after fintech-law analysis.

## 9. Funding ask

**$5,000 USDC.**

Use of funds (line-itemized for accountability):

| Use | Amount | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Litepaper translation (EN / ES / PT) by professional Web3 translator | $1,200 | LatAm market reach + Brazil expansion prep |
| 60-second institutional pitch video (script + animator) | $1,500 | Sales asset for Bankaool / Arkangeles formalizations |
| Integration documentation for top 5 Avalanche DApps | $800 | Trader Joe, Benqi, GMX-style protocols — onboarding kit |
| Domain + 1 yr hosting (kumply.io + monitoring) | $500 | Already paid; this reimburses |
| Smart-contract internal review by 1 external Solidity dev before audit | $1,000 | De-risk before $25K formal audit in Q3 |

100% of $5K consumed within 60 days of disbursement. Monthly receipts shared in a public GitHub issue for transparency.

## 10. Milestones for follow-on phases (Team1 phases 2-4)

| Phase | Milestone | Approximate cost |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | OpenZeppelin / Code4rena smart-contract audit | $25K |
| 2 | Mexican fintech-law written counsel opinion | $15K |
| 3 | KUMPLY L1 mainnet launch + first 3 institutional validators onboarded | $50K (legal + infra) |
| 3 | KYA Tier-5 (`AgentRegistry.sol`) implementation + 1 agentic-DeFi pilot DApp | $35K |
| 4 | Colombia + Brazil market expansion (legal + integrations) | $60K |

## 11. Why Avalanche

- **ACP-77 + ACP-99 enable custom institutional L1s with PoA governance** — exactly what regulated entities need (control over validator admission, deterministic finality, no MEV chaos).
- **ICM for cross-L1 attestation propagation** — KUMPLY attestations issued on C-Chain propagate to every Avalanche L1, making us a network-wide primitive, not a single-chain product.
- **Sub-second finality + low fees** — critical for high-frequency agentic transactions (KYA Tier 5 use case).
- **LatAm market traction** — Avalanche already has strong LatAm developer mindshare; KUMPLY accelerates institutional adoption to match.

## 12. Team

Solo founder for now. Hiring plan post-grant: 1 senior Solidity dev (Q3 2026), 1 full-stack TypeScript dev (Q4 2026), 1 BD lead for LatAm institutional sales (Q4 2026).
