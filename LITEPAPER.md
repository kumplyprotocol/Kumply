# KUMPLY — Institutional Compliance Infrastructure for Avalanche

**Litepaper · v1.1 · May 2026**

> One-line: KUMPLY is the on-chain identity and compliance layer for institutional Web3, built natively on Avalanche. We provide KYC, KYB, and KYA (Know Your Agent) attestations as a public good for DApps, plus a dedicated Compliance L1 where every validator is a verified institution.

## 1. The Problem

LatAm financial institutions face a structural blocker to adopting Web3: **regulatory uncertainty around counterparty identity**. A bank cannot interact with an EVM address without knowing who controls it. An enterprise cannot route a stablecoin payment without confirming the recipient passed KYC. A tokenization platform cannot list assets to qualified investors without verifying accreditation.

Today the workarounds are all bad:

- **Off-chain whitelists** (e.g. Polygon ID, Worldcoin) — sit outside the chain, require trust in a centralized issuer, and don't compose with smart contracts.
- **Per-DApp KYC** — every protocol re-onboards the same user, fragmenting compliance data and creating duplicate AML risk for institutions.
- **Wrapped permissioned chains** (e.g. Quorum, Hyperledger) — break composability with the wider DeFi ecosystem and lock institutions into walled gardens.

The cost is concrete: digital banks and venture funds in Mexico, major banks in Brazil, and dozens of LatAm enterprises have publicly stated they want to deploy on-chain products but cite "no compliant counterparty resolution layer" as the gating concern.

## 2. The Solution

KUMPLY is a **two-layer compliance primitive on Avalanche**:

### Layer 1 — AttestationStore on C-Chain (live, deployed)
A smart contract that stores cryptographically signed KYC/KYB/KYA attestations on Avalanche C-Chain. Each attestation is a tuple `(address, tier, expiry, issuer)`. Five tiers map to real-world verification depth:

| Tier | Type | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Basic KYC | Wallet onboarding, low-risk DeFi |
| 2 | Standard KYC | Stablecoin payments, peer-to-peer transfers |
| 3 | Enhanced KYC | Lending, derivatives, tokenized assets |
| 4 | Business / KYB | Institutional accounts, validators |
| 5 | Agent / KYA | Autonomous AI agents and bots (new in 2026) |

DApps consume attestations through a **gateway pattern**: a `ComplianceGate` contract enforces a minimum tier before allowing protected actions, with two billing modes — `pay-per-use` (per-call fee in AVAX) and SaaS subscription (off-chain billed, on-chain exempt). Reading is free for public verification; writing only by KUMPLY's `VERIFIER_ROLE` (initially the protocol; later expanded to additional registered verifiers).

### Layer 2 — KUMPLY Compliance L1 (deploy-ready)
A dedicated Avalanche L1 (Subnet-EVM, chainId 43210) that is **open to all 5 tiers as users**, with KYB gating only at the security layer:

| Role on the L1 | Tier requirement | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Validators** (block producers) | Tier 4 (KYB) | Banks, enterprises, and regulated entities provide network security |
| **Contract deployers** | Tier 4 (KYB) | Audited, accountable code in the institutional ecosystem |
| **Transactors** (gas payers) | Any tier 0–5 | Retail KYC users, institutional accounts, and autonomous agents all transact freely |
| **Attestation readers** | Open | Public, free, permissionless |

The validator set is governed by `KumplyValidatorSetManager.sol`, our ACP-99-compliant ValidatorSetManager that enforces KYB on validator registration and self-heals when an attestation expires (anyone can permissionlessly purge an expired validator). DApps deployed on the L1 use tier-aware `ComplianceGate` contracts to admit Tier-1 retail users into peer-to-peer flows, Tier-3 enhanced-KYC users into lending markets, Tier-4 institutional accounts into qualified pools, and Tier-5 autonomous agents into agentic DeFi.

This is unique in the Avalanche ecosystem: it's the first L1 whose **security** is gated by on-chain compliance proofs *and* whose **applications** can tier-gate user actions without forcing the network into a permissioned walled garden. Banks, regulated enterprises, and licensed money transmitters can run validators with cryptographic assurance that every counterparty in the consensus set is verified — while individual users at every tier transact freely.

**Standards compliance verified by 110 unit tests:**

- **ACP-30** — Avalanche Warp × EVM (WarpMessenger precompile at `0x05`)
- **ACP-77** — Reinventing Subnets (continuous fee L1 validators)
- **ACP-99** — ValidatorSetManager contract (two-phase init/complete flow)
- **ACP-103** — Dynamic multidimensional fees (roadmap, post-launch)
- **Avalanche codec** — bit-exact `RegisterL1ValidatorMessage`, `L1ValidatorRegistrationMessage`, `L1ValidatorWeightMessage`, `SubnetToL1ConversionMessage` (re-implemented in the test harness for round-trip validation)

## 4. Why This Matters for Avalanche

KUMPLY closes the critical institutional adoption gap **and** opens a new primitive — verified autonomous agents — that doesn't exist anywhere else in the L1 ecosystem.

1. **🤖 KYA — Know Your Agent (unique in the Avalanche ecosystem)** — Tier 5 verifies autonomous AI agents and bots before they touch capital on-chain. As agentic DeFi grows (LangChain-style on-chain agents, autonomous market makers, AI portfolio managers), protocols need a way to distinguish trusted, bounded agents from anonymous scripts. To our knowledge, no other Avalanche L1 — and no other major EVM L1 — ships a purpose-built primitive for this today. Section 4.1 below details the mechanism.
2. **Brings real banks on-chain** — designed around the requirements of Mexican digital banks, venture funds, and LatAm enterprises. A KYB-gated L1 is the first deployment vehicle they can operate without straddling unclear regulatory perimeters.
3. **Open to retail users, not just institutions** — The L1 is a full home for the 5-tier compliance spectrum. Retail KYC users (Tiers 1–3) can transact freely; institutional accounts (Tier 4) can deploy contracts and validate; agents (Tier 5) can operate within bounded budgets. Compliance composes at the application layer via `ComplianceGate`, not by walling off the chain.
4. **Composable with existing Avalanche DeFi** — `ComplianceGate` integrates as a 3-line dependency for any C-Chain DApp wanting tiered users (Trader Joe institutional pools, GMX accredited markets, Benqi qualified lending).
5. **Cross-L1 attestation propagation via ICM** — Tier proofs issued on C-Chain propagate to any other Avalanche L1 via Interchain Messaging, making KUMPLY a network-wide identity primitive, not a single-chain product.
6. **First production use case for ACP-99** — Our open-source implementation is one of the earliest live integrations of the ValidatorSetManager standard, useful as reference for other institutional L1 builders.

### 4.1 KYA — Know Your Agent (Tier 5) — the unique differentiator

Autonomous agents present a verification problem that **classic KYC cannot solve**. An AI agent doesn't have a passport. A bot doesn't have a tax ID. But protocols still need to know: *"Can this address transact $50K of stablecoin in my pool? Is the entity behind it accountable? Does this agent have permission to do what it's trying to do?"*

KUMPLY Tier 5 (KYA) is a structured attestation specifically for autonomous actors:

| KYA Field | What it captures | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| **Model fingerprint** | Hash of model weights (open models) or pinned API endpoint + version (closed models) | KUMPLY attestor |
| **Owner attestation** | EVM address of a Tier-4 (KYB) human/institution that takes legal responsibility | On-chain proof of Tier-4 |
| **Behavior bounds** | Max tx/day, max value/tx, allowed contract allowlist, allowed assets, time-of-day windows | Owner-declared, immutable until reissued |
| **Provenance** | Training data jurisdiction, ToS hash, behavior policy URI | Owner-declared, IPFS-pinned |
| **Liveness signal** | Heartbeat oracle from the agent's runtime (proves it's still operating) | Off-chain runtime → on-chain timestamp |

DApps gate agent actions through an extended `ComplianceGate`:
```solidity
require(agentRegistry.canExecute(msg.sender, action, value), "AGENT_BOUND_EXCEEDED");
```

This unlocks **agentic DeFi with safety rails**: an autonomous market-making bot operates within its declared limits; if it deviates, the owner's KYB attestation gives counterparties legal recourse. No anonymous-LLM rug pulls. No "AI did it" legal voids.

**Why this lands on Avalanche specifically:** Avalanche's sub-second finality and low fees make it the natural home for high-frequency agentic transactions. ACP-77 L1s let us run a chain optimized for agent throughput separately from the broader institutional chain.

**KYA is in the Sumsub level catalog (`agent-kya`) and in `AttestationStore.sol`'s tier 5 today.** The `AgentRegistry.sol` extension contract is in our Q3 2026 roadmap as the next ship.

## 5. Business Model — Software-Only, B2B

KUMPLY operates as **infrastructure software**, not a financial institution. We do not custody funds, do not facilitate fiat/crypto exchange, do not issue tradable assets. Revenue comes from:

| Stream | Customer | Pricing | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SaaS subscription** | Regulated institutions (banks, enterprises) | MXN/USD monthly fixed (CFDI billing) | Direct sales |
| **Pay-per-use API** | DApps, autonomous agents, small teams | $0.50 USD per `checkCompliance` call, paid in AVAX | Smart contract |
| **L1 gas (KMP)** | Validators, DApps deploying on KUMPLY L1 | Native gas fees on L1 transactions | On-chain |
| **Verifier-as-a-Service** | KYC providers wanting on-chain distribution | License + revenue share | Partnership |

Pricing benchmark: traditional KYC providers (Sumsub, Onfido, Veriff) charge $1–8 per verification with no on-chain composability and no programmatic API for smart contracts. Our $0.50 per-check is a 50–94% cost reduction, plus the compliance data is reusable across every Avalanche DApp the user touches — meaning per-user lifetime cost trends toward zero as the network effect compounds.

## 6. Token: KMP

KMP is the **native gas token of the KUMPLY Compliance L1**. Its role is strictly utility — paying for computation and storage on the L1. KMP is not:

- not a security under LMV (Mexico) or US securities law analysis
- not e-money under applicable regulations
- not staked for validator rewards (validators are paid in AVAX via ACP-77 continuous fees on P-Chain)
- not listed on any DEX, AMM, or CEX
- not sold to the public

Testnet (Fuji) genesis allocation: **1,000,000,000 KMP, 100% to the KUMPLY operator wallet** for testnet faucet, demo grants, and validator gas top-ups. **Mainnet allocation is explicitly deferred** until: (a) on-chain traction is demonstrated, (b) institutional validator agreements are formalized, and (c) a written Mexican legal counsel opinion confirms the software-only positioning. This commitment is embedded as on-chain documentation in `genesis.json` itself.

## 8. Team & Traction

- **Two co-founders.** Giovanny Amador — technical lead: smart contracts, L1, SDK and infrastructure (authorship visible in the public commit history). Monserrat Mendoza — product, design and content lead; ETH Uruguay 2025 hackathon winner. Both are Team1 Network Collaborators (accepted July 2026).
- **Code:** monorepo with pnpm workspaces — contracts, SDK, API, web — 164 tests, CI on every push (GitHub Actions, 4 parallel jobs).
- **Go-to-market:** targeting Mexican digital banks, venture funds and LatAm enterprises. No commercial agreements are signed to date; any partner will be named only once a relationship is formalized.
- **Open source:** Apache 2.0 licensed (express patent grant, no trademark license), public GitHub, no proprietary lock-in.
- **Public commitment:** all smart contracts will be immutably renounced to a 3-of-5 multisig before mainnet; KMP mainnet genesis defined by community governance; quarterly treasury transparency reports starting Q4 2026.

## 9. Grant Programs & Funding Asks

We are applying to:

| Program | Amount | Use of funds |
|---|---|---|
| **Team1 Mini-Grant** | $10,000 USD, modular | Four milestones, fundable in tranches: **M1 ($1,500)** security hardening of `AttestationStore` + `ComplianceGate` (Slither, Aderyn, fuzzing, threat model) · **M2 ($3,500)** Sumsub production activation and first real KYC/KYB on C-Chain · **M3 ($2,000)** on-chain query-fee activation on Mainnet C-Chain · **M4 ($3,000)** Fuji L1 validator activation, ICM integration, 2 integration pilots. $5,000 funds M1–M2; $7,000 adds M3; $10,000 completes M4. Excludes formal L1 audit. |
| **Avalanche Retro9000** (C-Chain, future round) | Retroactive | Bringing KUMPLY to mainnet as compliance infrastructure: institutional validator-set bootstrap and formal smart-contract audit |
| **Blizzard Fund** | Seed round, terms TBD | Operating runway 12 months (legal, audits, BD) and engineering hires |

Capital efficiency is core: at $0.50 per-check pricing, breakeven on operating costs is reached at ~50K monthly verifications — a single mid-size LatAm enterprise customer.

## 10. Why We Win

Four structural moats:

1. **KYA category leadership.** Verified-agent infrastructure is a greenfield primitive — we are aware of no incumbent on Avalanche or on any major EVM L1. The Tier-5 attestation flow is live in `AttestationStore.sol` today; the `AgentRegistry.sol` extension and the reference DApp integration are the next ships (Q3 2026). First-mover position in a category we expect to matter as agentic DeFi scales.
2. **Network effects on compliance data.** Every additional institution that trusts KUMPLY attestations makes the next institution's onboarding decision easier. Once a first Mexican digital bank integrates, every other Mexican bank evaluating Web3 inherits a de-facto standard. Same dynamic for KYA: once a major agentic DeFi protocol requires KUMPLY Tier 5, every competing agent must register.
3. **Regulatory positioning that scales.** The software-only design — no custody, no exchange, no transmission of funds — is intended to keep KUMPLY outside regulated financial activity, and is architected to replicate jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction across LatAm without re-engineering. A written Mexican counsel opinion is engaged and pending; we make no legal determination ahead of it.
4. **Native ACP-99 implementation as the reference.** Other institutional L1s on Avalanche will need a KYB-gated ValidatorSetManager. Our open-source implementation becomes the canonical pattern, with KUMPLY positioned as the identity layer they integrate against.
